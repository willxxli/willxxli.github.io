I am a PhD candidate in Finance at the University of Queensland, working under the supervision of [Dr. Min Zhu](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/23163) and [Prof. Denis Leung](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/denis-leung-756) (Singapore Management University).

My research focuses on **Empirical Asset Pricing**, **Fintech**, **Cybersecurity**, and **AI Applications in Finance**. I am particularly interested in leveraging big data analytics and machine learning techniques to construct granular datasets that enhance financial decision-making.

I hold the **CFA** designation and have passed all levels of the **FRM** exams, achieving these milestones at the age of 22. My current work involves using LLMs and AI-based approaches to analyze SEC filings and construct textual data for understanding the institutional background of the asset management industry.

Prior to my PhD, I earned a Master of Finance from the University of Melbourne (First Class Honours) and a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Queensland, where I graduated with a perfect 7/7 GPA in Finance and Accounting (Top 1%) and was shortlisted for Valedictorian.

**Research Interests:** Empirical Asset Pricing, Fintech, Cybersecurity, Investment, Asset Management, Big Data Applications in Finance
